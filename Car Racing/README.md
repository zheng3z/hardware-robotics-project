# Embedded System Design Project

## Introduction

This final lab incorporates all the knowledge I learned in the class, including SPI, I2C, and AWS to produce an engaging game on the OLED screen. Firstly, I used SPI and carefully managed the spawning and moving down of new cars, represented by yellow rectangles, for users to avoid. Secondly, with the help of I2C, the user’s input can be seamlessly transferred to the control of the user’s own red rectangular car. To make the game more interesting, I added a stealth mode which enables the temporal invincible ability to the user’s car, so that users will have more choices of avoiding collisions. Finally, the AWS feature provides users their scores sent by the CC3200 board and they can decide whether to replay the game by sending messages to the AWS.
