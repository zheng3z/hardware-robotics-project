# Analog/Digial System Project

## Introduction

In this project, the robot is equipped with ears and can hear the sound from both left
and right. The main objective of this project is to let the robot decide whether it should go
forward, left, right, or backward based on the sound intensity it receives. The whole project
consists of six parts. The first part, calibrating two microphones to make them have roughly the
same magnitude. The second part is design filters to filter out unwanted noise. The third part is
to let the robot determine if there is sound and move if there’s sound while stop when there isn’t.
The fourth part is to give it the ability to judge whether to turn left or right based on left and right microphone intensity. And then in the fifth part, the robot now can move to the sound source.
And finally the most challenging sixth part, the robot has to turn back if he thinks the sound
source is from behind.

## Run This Project

Retrieving code from my old computer, comming soon.
